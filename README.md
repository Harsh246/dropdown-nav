Solution to Intro section with dropdown navigation


Some Points:
1. ul is not nested inside ul. make sure to place them inside li, if needed.
2. ul can only have li inside it. no divs, a tag. wrap anything else inside li.
3. transitions won't work in case of display:none to block. You can use animation for that.
4. Give enough padding to li in navbar.
